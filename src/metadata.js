This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. Unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Meanwhile, our drinkable water sources are finite: Less than 1 percent of the earth’s freshwater is actually accessible to us. To combat water pollution you can invest in water purifiers, to remove pollutants in the water, improving the quality of the water we consume, water cisterns, to help reduce dependence on drinking water supplied by the water system, which can help reduce pressure on water treatment plants and thus reduce the risk of pollution, organic fields, which can help reduce the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers, which can pollute groundwater, and parks, that can help protect water resources by promoting the conservation of natural ecosystems such as marshes and rivers.",
